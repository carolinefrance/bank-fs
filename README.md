# Bank-Full-Stack-App
The original code for this exercise was created by faculty for MiT xPro's Professional Certificate in Coding: Full Stack Development with MERN course (August 2022 cohort). I modified the appearance of the app with five CSS stylesheets. Styles in the components folder modify bootstrap components. Also, I optimized and added functionality to the JavaScript files, which include JSX elements.

### Project Description
This full-stack MERN banking app is from the course's Module 27 exercise: Tiered Bad Bank, and it is a capstone project. Viewers will see a single-page create React app that is an interface for a bank. The previous banking app focused on the front-end and simulated a backend. In contrast, this app incorporates the front-end, middleware, and back-end. Specifically, React is connected to an Express web server, Node.js, and MongoDB. Upon loading, the user needs to create an account and log in before being able to access the deposit, withdraw, and users' account information pages.

### Refactored from Previous Version
* Upon logging in, the user's e-mail appears in the top-right corner
* Log-in now incorporates OAuth2, so users can log in with their Google account
* Banking balance persists across log-ins
* Data are passed to a Mongo database instead of being written to a local file
Additional features include the following:
* Random account number generator for new account
* User role: employee, client
* Persistent user profile update

### Future Improvements
Here are some redesign/reconfigure ideas for this project:
* Connect user data to a database.
* Add stricter ES6 validation for form fields.
* Add options: currency, language, and dark mode.
* Make the design more responsive.

### View the Live App
* View the previous version's live build on Netlify at [https://carolinefrancebankingapp.netlify.app/](https://carolinefrancebankingapp.netlify.app/)
* View the current version's live build ...

### Locally Run the App
Download all files in the Bank-React-App repository into a directory on your computer. Open the directory in your code editor. You should have Node installed.

In the terminal or command prompt, run the following commands:

Open the directory with the app files in your code editor.
* cd/bank

Install the following dependencies:
*	npm install bootstrap
>>> bootstrap navigation and cards are used in this app

* npm install react-router-dom
>>> enables navigation between pages

* npm install react-bootstrap
>>> enables bootstrap functionality in react

* npm install react-hook-form
>>> enables functionality of forms in react

*	npm start
>>> app is now visible on your local computer in the browser at [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/)

### Technologies Used
# Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
